# Google Advanced Data Analytics Portfolio Project

## Overview

The Google Advanced Data Analytics Portfolio project is based on the certification of the namesake. The portfolio showcases artifacts on project planning, machine learning, predictive modeling, and experimental design to collect and analyse large amounts of data. 

The project is based on a business requirement of Tik Tok. TikTok users have the ability to report videos and comments that contain user claims. These reports identify content that needs to be reviewed by moderators. This process generates a large number of user reports that are difficult to address quickly. The project involves creating a machine learning model to determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion. With a successful prediction model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritise them more efficiently.

## Modules

### 1. Foundations of Data Science (Project Proposal)

#### Description

This module focuses on the PACE document framework which outlines the various stages of the project. The module project involves creating the PACE document and project proposal.  

### 2. Preparing and organising data

#### Description

This module focuses on the basics of Python as a programming language. The module project involves building a dataframe for the claims classification data (.ipynb file). Key variables and observations are identified that will be further explored at the exploratory data analysis stage. 

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
